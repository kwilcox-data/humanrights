//these are our project instructions; they are due Friday, October 18, 2019//

Each team (from last week) creates a project pitch website for the project they envisioned last week.

The website should contain a landing page and several sub pages.

Each sub page should correspond to one of the sections in the vision document.

You should also have a sub page for “the team” with a pic and a bio for each of the team members

Have all of these files on a GitHub repo

Publish the files to the web using GitHub Pages

 Use a front end framework (Bootstrap, Ink, Foundation 5, etc) to create the site
 
 Super extra points for teams that use Jekyll (NB – Codecademy has a tutorial on Deploying a Website with Jekyll)
 
Add additional content beyond the original vision document as you see fit.
